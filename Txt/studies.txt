Linux Commands 2:
cd (change directory): change currently folder directory. (cd ..) come one folder back. also typing cd whenever folder you are, we go back to our main directory, if the directory (or a file) we want to use have space we need to use '' like 'File Directory'.
mkdir(make directory): create a folder specifying the name, example mkdir other, will create a folder named other.
rmdir(remove directory) will remove a folder from the local.
touch: will create a new file but will not replace one that already exists.
rm(remove) remove files.
cp(copy): will copy a file after specifying another name for the copy. example cp Story Story2.
mv(move): move the file to another directory after specifying the file name, local where is going to be moved and the name of the file. example mv story2 Other/story2. mv also rename the file after moving so if we want just to rename a file we just use mv the currently name of the file and the new name. example: mv story tuna.
