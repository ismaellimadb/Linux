Files Permitions in Linux:
Typing the command ls -l will show us a list of files and hidden files in the directory also showing some weird looking syntax like:
rwx
the r means we can read
the w means we can write
the x means we can execute

this syntax is separeted in order for the u- user, g- a group, and o - other peaple

chmod will change the permitions of a file using the syntax 'chmod o+w filename' for example, will change the file permition so outside peple can write the file.'chmod o-w filename' will remove the write permission instead.

Changing the permission of a lot of group individuals, example:

chmod u  g  o  filename
      s  r  t
      e  o  h
      r  u  t
         p  e
            r  

example:
chmod 7  5  4  filename

The 7 Stands for read,write and execute so the User will have these permissions.
The 5 Stands for read and execute so the Group will have these permissions.
The 4 Stands for read, so Others will have the permission to read.
2 Stands for write.
1 Stands for execute.
6 Stands for read and write permissions.
0 Stands for 'no permissions'.
